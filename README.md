# ðŸ“˜ AlgoRack â€“ A Book-Selling NFT Marketplace on Algorand

AlgoRack is a decentralized NFT marketplace where authors can mint and sell digital books (eBooks, articles, research papers) as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Algorand blockchain. It leverages smart contracts written in `algopy` to securely manage book listings and purchases, with NFT creation handled on the frontend using `algosdk`.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **NFT Creation (Frontend)**
  - Authors mint NFTs for their books using the frontend.
  - Each book is represented as an ASA (Algorand Standard Asset) with:
    - Total supply of 1 (NFT)
    - Asset name, unit name, metadata link (e.g., IPFS)
    - Zero decimals (indivisible)

- âœ… **List Book for Sale**
  - After creating the NFT, the author lists it for sale by deploying the smart contract using `create_application(asset_id, price)`.

- âœ… **Opt-In to Asset**
  - The smart contract can opt-in to hold the NFT before sales begin.

- âœ… **Buy Book (NFT)**
  - Buyers pay in ALGO and receive the NFT directly via the `buy()` function in the smart contract.

- âœ… **Close Sale**
  - Authors can delete the contract, reclaim unsold NFTs and earned ALGO via `delete_application()`.

## ðŸ”— Workflow

1. **NFT Creation (Frontend)**  
   The author uploads a book and metadata. The frontend uses `algosdk` to call a `createNFT()` function that mints an ASA with a total supply of 1.

2. **Smart Contract Deployment**  
   The NFTâ€™s asset ID is passed to the smart contractâ€™s `create_application(asset_id, unitary_price)` method.

3. **Opt-In to the Asset**  
   The contract opts in to hold and sell the book NFT using `opt_in_to_asset()`.

4. **Purchase**  
   Buyers interact with the `buy()` method, pay the specified amount in ALGO, and receive the NFT.

5. **Close & Reclaim**  
   When the sale is over, the author can close the contract with `delete_application()` to recover all remaining assets.

## ðŸ§  Smart Contract Functions

| Function | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create_application(asset_id, unitary_price)` | Initialize the marketplace app for a book NFT |
| `set_price(new_price)` | Update the unit price |
| `opt_in_to_asset()` | Smart contract opts in to receive the NFT |
| `buy(payment_txn, quantity)` | Buyer sends ALGO and receives the book NFT |
| `delete_application()` | Author deletes the contract and reclaims funds and unsold NFTs |
